Email is a very valuable communication tool, but it is also an incredible distraction. Many people talk about how to manage incoming email with methodologies like [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com). These are extremely important techniques, but I have been most successful at reducing the amount of email that I even get. This allows me to be extra responsive to my clients and my customer support requests, while not being constantly bombarded by unnecessary distractions.

I did three major things to reduce the email I receive:
1. I began by unsubscribing from virtually all email lists. When I want news about something, a coupon, or information about a product, I will go search it out. I don’t need it coming into my inbox.

2. I then turned off almost all app email notifications. I don’t need emails from Facebook or Twitter, my apps will alert me to those anything I need to know through push notifications.

3. Finally, I use email aliases for virtually everything. I run my own email server so this is easier for me but it is still possible with gmail and most other email services. I have a few core accounts like “financial”, “accounts”, and “client-name”. I then append a suffix on that for each place I give out my email. For example, if I needed to sign up for an account at Initrode, I would use accounts+initrode@example.com. Most email services allow you to use a plus sign to ignore everything after and including it. I can put anything after the plus sign and they will all go to accounts@example.com which then forwards to my personal email. This allows me to easily blacklist an entire address if a site is compromised and that email gets out. This way, I get virtually no spam and I can also easily filter my email.
