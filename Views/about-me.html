<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="/assets/img/profile.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" />
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  My name is Andrew Wagner. I have a passion for <strong>product and user experience development</strong>. I don't care what technologies or skills I
  have to learn as long as they allow me to shape the products I develop to provide the best experience possible for its users.
  That is the perspective I bring to all of my development including my programming.
</p>
<p>
  My main skills are in programming and user experience, but I have dabbled in graphic design, product
  design, marketing, business development, and everything else involved in turning an idea into a
  marketable reality.
</p>

<h2>A Bit More Personal</h2>

<p>I don't feel like I fit into any classical mold of a profession. My main training is in Software Engineering
but I have also studied User Experience and even a little bit of Graphic Design. My main passion is developing
amazing user experiences that hopefully push society forward. This can be as technical as creating an
understandable and maintainable API to helping shape the emerging world of Speech Interfaces.</p>

<p>I pride myself in having strong opinions but also a huge willingness to be persuaded differently. I have a hard
time holding back my opinions but I love to discuss them with others, especially when they have opposing positions.</p>
